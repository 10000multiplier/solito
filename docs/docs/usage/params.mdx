```tsx
import { createParam } from 'solito'

const { useParam } = createParam()
```

A hook that lets you read screen parameters on Next.js and Native. It also lets you update the parameter, using query parameters on Web, and React state on iOS/Android.

## Usage

```tsx
import { createParam } from 'solito'

type Query = { username: string }

const { useParam } = createParam<Query>()

export const UserName = () => {
  const [username, setUsername] = useParam('username')

  return <Text>{username}</Text>
}
```

You'll `useParam` this instead of `useRoute` from React Navigation, and instead of `useRoute().query` from Next.js.

## Expo + Next.js Query Params State

A typical use-case on web for maintaining React State is your URL's query parameters. It lets users refresh pages & share links without losing their spot in your app.

URL-as-state is especially useful on Next.js, since `next/router` will re-render your page with shallow navigation.

This gist lets you leverage the power of URL-as-state, while providing a fallback to React state for usage in React Native apps.

It's essentially a replacement for `useState`.

First, create the schema for your query parameters:

```ts
type Query = {
  bookingId: string
  template: 'story' | 'square'
}
```

> The values of `Query` must be primitives, such as strings/booleans/numbers, since you can't use nested fields in a URL with next router.

Next, we're going to generate our `useParam` function:

```ts
type Query = {
  bookingId: string
  template: 'story' | 'square'
}

const { useParam } = createParams<Query>()
```

This usage of a factory is similar to `react-navigation`'s `createStackNavigator`. It allows us to have great TypeScript safety.

## Usage

Now that we've created our `useParam` function, call it in your component:

```ts
type Query = {
  bookingId: string
  template: 'story' | 'square'
}

const { useParam } = createParams<Query>()

export function App() {
  const [bookingId, setBookingId] = useParam('bookingId')
}
```

Whenever you call `setBookingId`, it will update the query parameter in the URL. To remove the query parameter, call `setBookingId(null)`.

On native, this will function as normal React State.

### Initial value

With React state, we pass an initial value like this:

```ts
const [selected, setSelected] = useState(true)
```

With `useParam` we achieve the same thing with the `initial` property:

```ts
const [template, setTemplate] = useParam('template', {
  initial: 'story',
})
```

However, on web, this might not aways be the initial value. This is because the initial value itself could be set from the URL on the first navigation.

`initial` gets used on web when these two cases are satisfied:

1. the query param (in this case, `template`) is `undefined`
2. you haven't called the set state function yet (in this case, `setTemplate`)

There is might appear to be an edge case here. What happens if you call `setTemplate(null)`? This will remove the query parameter from the URL, so we're left with an empty state. But it also won't fall back to the `initial` field, since this wouldn't match the React state behavior.

Can we find a way to provide a fallback value on web in this case, to make sure that our URL isn't the only source of truth?

The solution lies with the `parse` field.

### Parsing values

One issue with having state in URLs is, users have an API to inject whatever state they want into your app.

This could break in many ways.

Take our `Query` type we wrote earlier:

```ts
type Query = {
  bookingId: string
  template: 'story' | 'square'
}
```

Our `template` is a **required** field that accepts `square` or `story`.

A naive approach would use it like this:

```ts
const [template, setTemplate] = useParam('template', {
  initial: 'story',
})
```

There are two problems here: what if the URL doesn't have `template`? Or worse, what if it _does_ have `template`, but it doesn't match one of the types you specified?

Enter `parse`:

```ts
type Query = {
  bookingId: string
  template: 'story' | 'square'
}

const { useParam } = createParams<Query>()

const [template, setTemplate] = useParam('template', {
  initial: 'story',
  parse: (templateFromUrl) => {
    if (templateFromUrl === 'story' || templateFromUrl === 'square') {
      return templateFromUrl
    }
    return 'story'
  },
})
```

`parse` is the final piece of the puzzle. It lets you ensure that any state you're using from your URL is "safe".

It's also strictly typesafe, which is an added bonus.

The argument it receives will always be a string

`parse` gets run when this case is satisfied:

1. the query param (in this case, `template`) is not `undefined`

## Types

This hook has great strict types.

The state value it returns will always be `State | undefined`, unless you pass _both_ an `initial` value and `parse`. That way, we know that on both web and native, we're always using values which match our state.

## Stringify

It's possible you'll want to customize the way that the query param is stored in the URL.

If so, you can use the `stringify` property:

```ts
type Query = {
  bookingId: string
  template: 'story' | 'square'
}

const { useParam } = createParams<Query>()

const [bookingId, setBookingId] = useParam('bookingId', {
  stringify: (bookingId) => {
    // if we call setBookingId('123')
    // URL will be ?bookingId=artist-123
    return `artist-${bookingId}`
  },
  parse: (bookingIdFromUrl) => {
    return bookingIdFromUrl.replate('artist-', '')
  },
})
```
