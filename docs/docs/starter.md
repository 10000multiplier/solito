title: Starter Project

To get you up and running instantly, I created a starter monorepo with all the annoying config done for you.

```sh
npx create-solito-app@latest my-solito-app
```

You can see the monorepo and what comes installed here: https://github.com/nandorojo/solito/tree/master/example-monorepos/blank

For now, there is only one template available.
