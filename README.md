# Solito

A library dedicated to unifying React Native with Next.js, primarily focused on navigation.

> This is still experimental. 

Solito is a replacement of my popular `expo-next-react-navigation` library. Consider it the next-generation version. You can still use both in an app. But for all future use cases, I recommend solito over `expo-next-react-navigation`.
